# Quality Gate Check

Verify quality gate criteria are met before proceeding to the next phase.

## Execution

Subagent — spawned via subagent-spawning/spawn-agent skill.

## Why Subagent

Quality gate verification requires independent assessment against criteria, free from sunk-cost bias of the producing agent.

## Gate Types

| Gate | Checks |
|------|--------|
| Budget Gate | Quantitative floor met (factor count, matrix rows, etc.) |
| Minimum Yield | Required deliverables present and non-trivial |
| HARD-GATE | Preconditions satisfied before starting |
| Completeness | All required sections/fields populated |
| Consistency | No internal contradictions |
